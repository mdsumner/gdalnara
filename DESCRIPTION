Title: Read Imagery Data Directly to 'nativeRaster' With 'GDAL'
Version: 0.0.1

Description: Read imagery data from any GDAL source to R's nativeRaster matrix. The 
 nativeRaster is largely undocumented, an integer-encoded RGB/A matrix in raster-orientation, 
 used by 'rasterImage()' and the png package. Doing the conversion from raw bytes in GDAL saves a significant
 amount of time and memory to get a picture from a raster source (file or URL or other GDAL supported raster).
